# Welcome to my projects!

Here, I share my projects, and many resources I have gathered along my coding journey that are very useful to me.

Go to my projects:

In each project folder, I list specific resources for that language and libraries I use.

The list below are general resources that I find useful

- Git- and GitHub-related
    - [Improve your GitHub profile](https://towardsdatascience.com/build-a-stunning-readme-for-your-github-profile-9b80434fe5d7)
    - [Collection of gitignore files](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
